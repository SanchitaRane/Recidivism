# Recidivism Analysis and Predictive Modeling

## Overview

This project aims to analyze recidivism data to identify key factors influencing reoffending rates and develop a predictive model for recidivism within three years of release. The analysis includes demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral factors, providing actionable insights to drive policy decisions, optimize resource allocation, and improve rehabilitation programs.

## Objectives

1. Conduct a comprehensive analysis of recidivism patterns and trends.
2. Identify key demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral factors influencing recidivism.
3. Develop a predictive model to forecast recidivism risk.

## Key Business Questions

1. What is the current recidivism rate, and how does it vary across different segments?
2. Which factors have the most significant impact on recidivism rates?
3. How can we identify high-risk individuals for targeted interventions?

## Methodology

### Data Preparation and Cleaning
- Ensure data quality and consistency.
- Handle missing values.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyze distributions and relationships between variables.
- Identify initial patterns and trends.

### Statistical Analysis
- Conduct correlation analyses.
- Perform hypothesis testing to validate relationships.

### Predictive Modeling
- Develop and validate a recidivism risk prediction model.
- Evaluate model performance and refine as needed.

### Business Impact Analysis
- Quantify the potential impact of identified factors on recidivism rates.
- Estimate cost savings from proposed interventions.

## Results

### Data Insights - Demographic Factors
- **Gender**: Males have a higher recidivism rate than females.
- **Race**: Black individuals have a slightly higher recidivism rate compared to White individuals.
- **Education Level**: Higher education levels are associated with lower recidivism rates.
- **Age Group**: Younger individuals are more likely to reoffend, with the highest recidivism rate among those aged 18-22.

### Data Insights - Behavioral Factors
- **Supervision Risk Score**: Higher scores are associated with higher recidivism.
- **Prison Years**: Slightly longer sentences are associated with lower recidivism.
- **Prior Arrests and Convictions**: More prior arrests and convictions correlate with higher recidivism.
- **Program Attendance**: Lower attendance in programs correlates with higher recidivism.
- **Unexcused Absences**: More unexcused absences are associated with higher recidivism.
- **Delinquency Reports**: More delinquency reports correlate with higher recidivism.

### Chi-Square Test Results
- **Gender and Recidivism**: Significant association with p-value < 0.0001.
- **Race and Recidivism**: Significant association with p-value < 0.0002.
- **Education Level and Recidivism**: Strong significant association with p-value < 0.0001.
- **Dependents and Recidivism**: Significant association with p-value < 0.0001.

### Predictive Model Performance
- **Accuracy**: 0.65
- **Precision**: 0.66
- **Recall**: 0.81
- **F1 Score**: 0.73
- **ROC AUC Score**: 0.69

### Recommendations
1. **Gender-Specific Interventions**: Develop programs tailored for males.
2. **Educational Programs**: Enhance educational opportunities for incarcerated individuals.
3. **Youth-Focused Programs**: Create targeted interventions for younger individuals.
4. **Cultural Competency in Programs**: Ensure programs address the specific needs of different racial groups.
5. **Enhanced Supervision**: Focus on individuals with high supervision risk scores.
6. **Targeted Programs for Repeat Offenders**: Develop specialized programs for individuals with multiple prior arrests and convictions.
7. **Increase Program Engagement**: Implement strategies to increase attendance in rehabilitation programs.
8. **Address Delinquency Issues**: Intervene early when delinquency reports are filed.
